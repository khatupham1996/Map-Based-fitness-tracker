# Map-Based Fitness Tracker
- **Live Geo-Mapping:** Tap anywhere on the map to log a new workout at that precise location, then watch as markers spring to life showing your route.  
- **Data Capture:** Enter distance, duration, cadence (for running) or elevation gain (for cycling), and PulsePath instantly calculates pace or speed—no manual math required.  
- **Dynamic Pop-ups & Descriptions:** Each session is automatically stamped with an emoji icon (🏃‍♂️ or 🚴‍♀️), a human-readable title, and opens a stylized popup when selected.  
- **Persistent History:** All your workouts are saved in local storage so you can close the browser and return anytime without losing a single run or ride.  
- **Smooth UX:** The form gracefully shows and hides on map clicks, input fields swap dynamically between cadence and elevation, and the map pans and zooms with animated transitions when you revisit past workouts.  
- **Exhilarating Journey:** With PulsePath, every route, milestone, and personal best comes alive on the map.
